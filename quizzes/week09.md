# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance is when one class inherits properties from another class. When we use the 'extends' keyword when declaring a class, we are utilizing inheritance.
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The singleton design pattern is utilized when we are classing objects. The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of an object exists at one time, and that instance provides a global access point to that state.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The observer pattern allows us to 'watch' a variable and, whe a change to that variable occurs, update other variables or the DOM accordingly.
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The strategy design pattern allows us to have multiple, isolated processes that relate to the same task or object. At runtime, we can execute any of these processes depending on a specific factor, such as user input. This allows us to manipulate data in specific ways as desired or required in different circumstances.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The factory method allows us to create different types of objects depending on user input. The types of objects may be similar, sharing most of their properties with some small differences. The type of object created is dependent on what is passed through by the user. For example, if the user is creating an employee object, we may have slightly different object depending on if they are full-time or part-time.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test driven development consists of developing, unit testing, and refactoring. It is a test as you go approach, with a goal of functional, bug-free, high-quality code.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
DoD stands for 'definition of done'. Each organization should establish what 'done' means so there is a clear expectation and goal when working on a project. 'Done' doesn't mean perfect, so it should be clear what it does mean.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
User stories are examples of tasks or goals a user may have when using an application. For example,
-"As a user, I want to be able to log in, then see a list of my friends who are online."
-"I should be able to click on the plus button, then be prompted to enter and submit my information"
```
