## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this week's readings did you implement?

We didn't have a partner project this week, but the reading still helped me with my checkpoint. Considering the user experience is something that is increasingly important the more complicated an application becomes. We want to be able to display all necessary information in a concise and coherent way, without crowding the display or having confusing navigation. Additionally, maintaining consistent naming conventions and documenting your code makes it much easier to go back and address anything that may need changed later.

2. What went well this week?

The checkpoint this week went very smoothly, I feel very confident with my current Vue and Node skills, and I look forward to continuing to utilize and improve those skills.

3. What would you do differently?

The main thing I know I need to learn more about very soon is accessibility tags. I understand needing to have title tags or aria labels, but there are many other important accessibility options that I would highly value learning how to utilize.
