## Questions

1. What is the ***user experience***? What should be considered when developing to create a good UX?

The user experience refers to the way the user interacts with your application/website and how effective/comfortable that experience is. Regardless of the goal of the application, the user experience needs to be weighed heavily when making design and functionality decisions. Not only should developers make a site that achieves the goal, they should also make a site that is accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable for the user.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the user experience?

By taking into account the user experience, we can ensure that the application being developed will provide a simple and effective method to accomplish the goals of the user, whether that's making a purchase or just effectively delivering the desired information.

3. Why is the user experience important?

The user experience is arguably one of the most important things about an app, after functioning code of course. At the end of the day, the app is developed solely as a way for the user to make and send requests to the owner of that application. Again, those requests could be something like a purchase order or just a simple request for data to be displayed to their page. Whatever the end result is, we need to ensure that the user has a smooth experience in arriving there.
