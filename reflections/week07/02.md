## Questions

1. What is ***code documentation***? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is a way of making our code clearer. For example, we can denote the role of a function or what arguments it takes and their data types. This makes our code easier to read for anyone who is looking at it for the first time, or even for ourselves after time has passed. Some ways to document code could be a README or a how-to, but it seems that the most effective and specific way to document code would be with JSDoc.

2. What are some benefits of code documentation?

Code documentation allows our code to be more easily read by anyone else who may view it. Whether it's in a popular public repository, or possibly a project done as an employee for a company where colleagues may be working in the same files.

3. How important is code documentation and why?

Code documentation could play a critical role in the readability of one's code, especially if naming conventions are not clear. It could save a significant amount of time in deciphering what the existing code is doing, allowing the desired changes to quickly be targeted and executed.
