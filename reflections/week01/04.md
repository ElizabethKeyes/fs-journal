## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***? 

Wireframing allows us to get an idea of what our site is going to look like before we start coding. This streamlines the coding process and makes a great road-map for moving forward.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wireframes, and why is each one useful?

There are low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes ranging in detail. Depending on the setting, any of these three have their applications. If you're just trying to get someone to see the general idea of what you're thinking, a low-fi wireframe would be fine. If you're building a complicated website or presenting something to a group of people, a mid or high-fidelity wireframe would be necessary.

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Though they could be time consuming depending on the site, I definitely think wireframes are worth the time and effort. Being able to shift some brain power from design to coding is very helpful. Once the wireframe is done, the task is much more like cloning a site than creating one from nothing.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment showed me how valuable a high-fidelity wireframe can really be. When focus moves towards making the page look how it should instead of making those decisions, the process goes a lot smoother, faster, and more predictably. It takes the design questions out and provides a binary way of looking at it: Does it match, or do we need to change it?
