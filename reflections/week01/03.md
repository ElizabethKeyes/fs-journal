## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip for improving your design? How does it benefit your site?

I've always seen myself as someone who isn't very "design-minded" or very great with colors but that article showed me that it's not all about "having the eye". It can be very cause and effect when looking for items to change. If your background is "x", you can emphasize or improve view by changing "y" on the page content. Also understanding that keeping the same hue and changing the saturation and lightness can make selecting secondary colors far less intimidating.

2. Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design and layout are extremely important both in terms of the look itself, but also to make the site more intuitive to users. Design can help to convey importance of various items on the screen, urgency through color, or maybe even prompting the user to read certain things on the page first. If a user visits a basic, ill-designed site, we can't expect them to have a professional opinion on that business. Design matters!

Bootstrap is an extremely useful tool! It will take some time to get accustomed to the predetermined styles and memorize enough classes to really move through things, but the potential for this library is definitely apparent!
