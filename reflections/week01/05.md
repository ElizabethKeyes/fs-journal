# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


It was great to hit the ground running this week. It felt like I had spent so much time preparing and building it up in my head that I was pretty nervous to actually start, but everything feels like it's flowing pretty well. The review of HTML and CSS was a breeze, but when we started with Bootstrap I was having troubles with the grid system for a couple days. I did some additional studying at home and it is really clicking for me now. It's a very useful and intuitive system, especially now that I'm memorizing more of the classes.

I also have a much better understanding of a few things I had been introduced to in the pre-course work, such as `position:relative` and `position:absolute`. Things are starting to click and it feels satisfying to be able to produce a web page that looks and acts as I had intended it to.
