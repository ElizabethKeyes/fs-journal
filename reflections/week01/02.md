## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A pseudo-class is a keyword added onto a selector in CSS. They allow us to add additional, sometimes invisible qualifications to our CSS classes. "hover" is a good example, only being utilized when the mouse is on the specified element. This can be helpful to emphasize or animate an object. "checked" could also be useful for various forms.

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity essentially refers to the "weight" given to various selectors. Selectors with higher specificity will overpower those with lower specificity if they're targeting the same element. If one or two words needs bolded or a different color, the styling for the rest of that section would need to be overridden with a higher specificity.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

Since the `!important` feature has such high specificity, it may prevent CSS styling from actually applying to your elements since any overlapping styles would defer to the `!important` tag.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I gained a lot from playing around with `display:flex` and its various properties. I was a little confused after reading the Flexbox article yesterday, but the lecture and hands on practice really helped.
