## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git is used for source control and tracking changes to code, primarily. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches can be used to ensure that there is always a polished version of code that is presented to the user while also allowing a secondary version of the code to edit and test as you make changes.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git can be used to create, monitor, and update local repositories on your computer. GitHub allows us to save those repositories remotely as opposed to locally.
