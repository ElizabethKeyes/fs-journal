## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

You can print to the console using console.log(""). Error messages, if any, will also print to the console with a reference to which line of code caused the message to be thrown.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS, and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab shows the full breakdown of HTML and CSS, allowing us to make small changes that will be immediately visible. Once the site looks the way it should, that code can be saved and kept. If it doesn't look right, a simple page refresh will bring it back to where it started.

3. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using breakpoints in the sources tab is a great way to debug code because it allows us to stop the code from running at any point that we decide. This way, we can discover where issues are arising without editing, saving, and refreshing every time we make an edit.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Getting my cart to draw to the page proved to be pretty difficult because of the way I laid out my HTML. Instead of being able to use  template to populate the cart, I had to use string interpolation to populate each individual property of each item since they were located in different areas. Next time, I would take some time to think about that before laying everything out in order to streamline my JS functions.
