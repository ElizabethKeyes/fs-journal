## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

There are function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions. Function declarations are hoisted to the top of the code and may be used before they are defined, function expressions and arrow expressions may not. 

2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?

Parameters are defined when writing a function and allow that function to receive arguments. Arguments are the actual values that are passed through to the function once it is called. 

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

When a function receives another function as an argument or returns another function, it is considered a higher-order function. forEach() is a common higher order function.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Though I had used for loops and the `forEach()` function, I was far less familiar with the use and applications of `.filter()`, `.find()`, and `Math.random()`. After using them on today's application, I feel more confident in their use, and I can see multiple applications where these functions could prove to be very useful and timesaving.
