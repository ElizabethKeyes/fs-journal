## Questions

1. What is ***scope***?

Scope determines where variables will be available in your code. Global variables are available throughout your code, or globally scoped. Whereas local variables may only be available within a single function, or function scoped.

var - can have global or function scope, depending on position. They can also be updated or re-declared within their scope.

let - has block scope, meaning it will only be read within the block of code it resides within. It cannot be re-declared within that same block, though its value can be reassigned. 

const - also has block scope, though it cannot be updated or re-declared (if const is an object, its properties can still be updated). Must be initialized at the time of declaration.

2. What is ***Hoisting***?

Hoisting essentially means that variables are lifted to the top of their scope. This declares the variables, but var is the only one that is initialized upon hoisting.

var - hoisted and initialized as undefined

let and const - hoisted and declared, not initialized.


3. In what cases might you use `let` vs. `const` vs. `var`?

Let should be used when the value of a variable may need to be redefined later on. Const should be used when the value of our variable will remain static. Var is trickier since it's scope it so large, it can end up unintentionally being redefined or re-declared and no errors will throw. It is likely best to use let instead in most cases.
