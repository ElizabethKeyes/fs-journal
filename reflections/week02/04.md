## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan for your application before starting to write the code?

Programming is both a logical and a creative process. It's good to be able to isolate these a little bit in order to give them both the attention they need. It's great to start with a plan or outline that you can stick with as you begin writing actual code. Planning too much can be difficult as well, though. There will always be unforeseen hiccups that need to be dealt with or more efficient methods that are determined once a project is already underway.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google and trusted forums are really your best friend. It's unlikely that any problem I've run into is a unique-to-me problem. There's usually plenty of resources online if you know how to search for them.

3. What coding mistakes would you be most likely to make? What advice from this article do you find most helpful?

Right now, as a beginner, I've found myself sometimes writing functions that are redundant then having to go back and refactor them later. In part, I feel it's simply due to needing more hours behind the keyboard and that will come with time. I also need to work on slowing down and doing some pseudo-coding before writing my functions. This will allow me to see those patterns before I've written a lot of code I'll then need to change. Focus on finding the best, simplest solution, not necessarily the first solution.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The Boss Monster assignment was my first time utilizing `setInterval()` for one of our functions. It definitely adds opportunities for adding more features to a game or application and it was fun to mess around with. We also started getting into a lot more logic with JavaScript which I'm really enjoying.
