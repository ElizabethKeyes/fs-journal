# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going?

Today went well, I spent a few hours on my application over the weekend and today was really productive as well. I'm feeling confident about this assignment, and I feel that it will be a great one to showcase on my resume or my future landing page.

- Are you managing your stress?

Surprisingly, I'm not feeling overly stressed about this application. The last few months, though intense, have really set me up for success here and I am sincerely enjoying the process.

- What has you most worried?

The most worrying thing to me right now is finding a job after CodeWorks is over. I'm sure it'll happen for all of us, I just worry that it's going to take longer than anticipated. I've really enjoyed my time here and it's bittersweet to be leaving.
