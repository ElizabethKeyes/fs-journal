# Daily Reflection
One day left! You can do it! We believe in you!ðŸ’– Are you timeboxing appropriately? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

Today was pretty productive. I'm done with my final at this point so I spent my time working on my GitHub readme, hosting a couple of my applications on render, and I started implementing some of the changes that Chelsea suggested for my LinkedIn page.

- Are you managing your stress?

I'm feeling pretty good these days. I'm excited for the end of the course, but still just have some nerves about what's to come.

- What has you most worried?

After graduation, I'd love to start learning React or potentially TypeScript. I'm a little nervous for the challenge of learning something unfamiliar with independent study. I'm sure I'll find great resources out there, it just feels a little intimidating to branch out without the instructors or TAs to lean on/ask questions.
