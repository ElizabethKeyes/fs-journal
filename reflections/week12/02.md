# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? Are you working from client -> server or focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

Today is going great. I was graded on my final checkpoint and was able to hit all the checkboxes aside from one. I look forward to addressing those bugs that we did find tomorrow and getting this to a point where I can earn that last duck!

- Are you managing your stress?

I'm doing my best to just focus on staying productive and doing the next thing that will benefit me. I'm trying not to think too far ahead or get too lost in my worries about the upcoming job search.

- What has you most worried?

Still just the job search. I'm looking forward to career week to hopefully get a little better handle on my plan for accomplishing this goal, it's just been years since I was last job searching so it's intimidating for sure.
