# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is your Vue application shaping up? Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

Today's going great. I'm working hard on making sure my website is functioning properly and is accessible. I'm passing with 100s on lighthouse for all my pages, and I've read and learned a lot about ARIA today, so that's been really valuable.

- Are you managing your stress?

Today isn't super stressful, honestly. Getting to a point yesterday where I was actually passing the final has taken a lot of that weight of. Today I'm feeling grateful for everything that I've learned these last few months, excited for what's to come, and of course nervous about the job search. I feel like that's definitely becoming a trend these days.

- What has you most worried?

I'm pretty nervous for mock interviews next week, as well as presenting our elevator pitches. I'm sure it'll go fine, it's just nerve wracking.
