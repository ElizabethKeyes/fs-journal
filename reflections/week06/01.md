## Questions

1. What is ***Component-Based Architecture***?

Component based architecture essentially divides the page up into individuals sections, called 'components'. Each component has its own functionality and operates independently from the other components on the display.

2. What are some benefits of Component-Based Architecture?

By using component based architecture, we can update individual components without needing to refresh the page or affecting any of the other components. This gives the page more flexibility, speed, and overall performance for the user. Even components that are composed of identical code can function completely independently, an example being chat windows for multiple people that may be open at the same time.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component-Based Architecture?

Because of the fact that each component is independent from one another, CBA when overused can quickly become very bulky and potentially lose some readability. CBA should be utilized only for specific instances in order to avoid this problem.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

It was great to get a quick glimpse into Vue today. I'm excited to get further into it and really see more of the functionality that it offers. So far, it seems like a very efficient and organized way to accomplish some of the things we've already been working on, but in even less time. As with anything new we've learned, I'll need some practice on the syntax but I'm really looking forward to continuing!
