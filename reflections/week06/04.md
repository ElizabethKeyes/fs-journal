## Questions

1. What is a **nested route***?

Say a website exists which details information about geography. There maybe an endpoint at `/continents` with a list of all the world's continents. There could be additional endpoints beyond this page as well. `/continents/SouthAmerica` could be a list of only the countries within that continent. This is an example of a nested route, where the way to navigate to South America's countries is through the continents page. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

Nested routes are useful for breaking up information. In the example I gave above, having all the countries listed within the continents page would be very lengthy. By breaking up the large countries list by continent, we allow a more concise way to deliver information and an easier, well-organized system for the user to navigate.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes, parameters can be passed down through routes. Say the path `/continents/SouthAmerica/blog` would show posts relating to the stated continent. We could use `.../blog/:blogId` to locate a specific post within that collection. This is helpful since that collection may grow to be very large. While there are a a known number of continents/countries, there is an unlimited possibility for the size of the blog section.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The more we work with Vue, the better I'm feeling with it. Today was pretty good, there are definitely some things I still need to work on remembering and improving upon, especially with the new syntax. We worked a lot more with two-way data-binding on forms today, as well as further practice with implementing components and passing props. I spent about 10 minutes trying to determine an issue that came down to a single letter needing capitalized, so I definitely need to make sure all of my naming conventions and references are spot-on moving forward.
