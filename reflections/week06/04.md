## Questions

1. What is a **nested route***?

Say a website exists which details information about geography. There maybe an endpoint at `/continents` with a list of all the world's continents. There could be additional endpoints beyond this page as well. `/continents/SouthAmerica` could be a list of only the countries within that continent. This is an example of a nested route, where the way to navigate to South America's countries is through the continents page. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

Nested routes are useful for breaking up information. In the example I gave above, having all the countries listed within the continents page would be very lengthy. By breaking up the large countries list by continent, we allow a more concise way to deliver information and an easier, well-organized system for the user to navigate.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes, parameters can be passed down through routes. Say the path `/continents/SouthAmerica/blog` would show posts relating to the stated continent. We could use `.../blog/:blogId` to locate a specific post within that collection. This is helpful since that collection may grow to be very large. While there are a a known number of continents/countries, there is an unlimited possibility for the size of the blog section.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's lab was another great exercise in partner programming. I've so far really enjoyed  partner programming. Though it can be slower at times, there truly is a benefit from having someone else to bounce ideas off of. Sometimes when working alone, you go with your first idea to solve a problem. However, having another person there forces you to spend a little bit longer coming up with and talking through a game plan to achieve the desired functionality.
