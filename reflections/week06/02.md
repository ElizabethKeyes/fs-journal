## Questions

Props are passed between components, and the receiving component can read and utilize the newly passed value.

2. What are props used for?

Props are used to share variables and other information between components.

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can only be passed down the component tree to descendants. Once they have been passed, they are read-only.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Vue is a little tricky, and I had an additional confusion with the API itself today. The lab was definitely challenging, but it was rewarding when things started to come together. I still need some practice with the computes and the props, but I'm sure that'll get easier with time. Overall, I am really looking forward to improving my Vue skills.
