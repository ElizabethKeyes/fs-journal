## Questions

1. What are ***lifecycle hooks***? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks allow us to perform certain actions at a specific time or before/after a specific event. For example, beforeDestroy and destroyed (respectively) can act on a piece of data before or at its time of destruction.

2. How have you used lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

In some ways, the observer pattern reminds me of what I've so far heard about lifecycle hooks. When using `appState.on()` to monitor a saved variable then update it to the page, it's similar to the `updated()` hook since we have a set list of actions to take every time the data is updated in order to draw it to the page again. Granted with vue, the actions at that time would not include a draw function on a reactive element.

3. What are ***mounting hooks***? When might you use them?

The `beforeMounted()` hook takes place after the template has been compiled, but before they are drawn to the page. The `mounted()` hook gives us full accessed to the reactive component and the fully rendered DOM. The mounted hook can be useful when using an API. Since the data isn't present on page load quite yet, if we call a function that requires that data, we will get errors. By calling that function once the page has mounted, we can ensure that our data has come through at the time the function is actually invoked.
