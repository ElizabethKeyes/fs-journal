Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

We made a lot of progress today. Our three new APIs are all functioning properly, we just need to continue fine tuning. We ran into some bugs and merge conflicts today, but we were able to resolve that throughout the day and we finished a lot further ahead than we were this morning. I'm looking forward to the Hackathon tomorrow and seeing where we arrive with the final product. This has been a really great experience overall.
