## Questions

1. What is an ***SSL certificate***?

SSL stands for 'Secure Sockets Layer'. An SSL certificate is a small data file that establishes an encrypted link between a server and a browser. This ensures that any and all data passed between the two remains private.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

Extended Validation - Most expensive certificate, highest level of assurance to users that all data is being collected and used legally. Shows the business name and country of origin in the address bar. Most frequently used by business who intend to process credit cards or collect sensitive data from users.

Organization Validation - Moderate level of encryption. Business name and green lock icon are visible to the user in the address bar.

Domain Validation - This is the quickest validation you can receive. Users will see the green lock icon in the address bar. This is a lower level of encryption and does not guarantee who is receiving the data on the other end.

Wildcard - If a certificate is purchased from one domain, it can also be used on subdomains.

Unified Communications - Can be associated with multiple domains. This could be an Extended Validation, or another type of validation. The significance is the fact that it is used by multiple domains.

Single Domain - Only used for one domain.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

SSL assures our users that our site is legitimate, that their data is safe, and makes them feel comfortable as a result. Additionally, it can protect our server from attacks, and is beneficial for SEO.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

We made a lot of progress today. Our three new APIs are all functioning properly, we just need to continue fine tuning. We ran into some bugs and merge conflicts today, but we were able to resolve that throughout the day and we finished a lot further ahead than we were this morning. I'm looking forward to the Hackathon tomorrow and seeing where we arrive with the final product. This has been a really great experience overall.
