## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

Our application is built using Vue and Node, of course. We're using multiple APIs to pull in all the necessary data and enable communication outside of our application via an email API. When we wrote our backend server, we made sure that we wrote it keeping RESTful conventions in mind for ease of use.

2. What went well so far?

Our team has been working great together. We've had many productive coding days, and our planning has been thorough and well discussed throughout this process.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

As with many of the applications we had heard about, we probably could've benefitted from additional planning/research. A couple of the APIs we chose to work with ended up being pretty difficult to get the hang of. After having already spent time trying to make them work we had to switch course and change to different APIs for a couple of our goals. 


Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

We are getting closer and closer to the minimum viable product goals that we had established for this project. It's been really great seeing everything come together. In order to stay on track this week, we need to get some more planning done and design a clear picture of what our ideal goals are.
