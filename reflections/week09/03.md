## Questions

1. What is a ***Base64 encoded image***?

Base64 is a way to represent binary data in a text format. A Base64 encoded image is simply an image file represented as plaintext.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 encoding?

By using Base64, file size is increased, therefore download times and bandwidth increase as well. Additionally, because Base64 images are stored within the HTML, the browser cannot cache the images locally. They will need to be retrieved each time that page is visited. Again, this will increase the user's bandwidth.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Previous browsers had limits on concurrent connections, so Base64 was an efficient work-around at the time in order to still pass through the desired data. Now that our internet browsers are much more efficient and can handle passing much more data, Base64 is an outdated solution that has more drawbacks than benefits in most scenarios.
