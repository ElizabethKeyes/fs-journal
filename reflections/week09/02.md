## Questions

1. What is a ***Github action*** and how do they work?

Github actions allow us to perform specific actions when certain conditions are satisfied. For example, they can be triggered by a push/pull request, someone forking or starring your repository, or they can be scheduled to run at a given time.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

Using Github actions, we could test our application, then perform a check to ensure those tests passed. If so, we could then deploy the application. 

3. What types of ***trigger actions*** can a workflow use? What do they do?

Workflow - A workflow action can be triggered from within another workflow run.
Scheduled - Executes the action at the provided time.
Webhooks - Webhooks monitor activity that happens outside of the repository itself. A repository dispatch event triggers the action, and a payload is sent back from the external source.
Other types of triggers - on release, on build, manual trigger, on Github pages build, or with any push/pull/fork/etc. request


Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today, we were trying to bring in three additional APIs to our project. One for email, maps, and a calendar. We ran into a significant number of problems and we didn't end up getting a significant amount of code written. However, we did learn a lot about these new APIs, and we have a much clearer picture of where we're going with the application itself in terms of getting these integrated. Our time was still well-spent.
