## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

One reason encapsulation first began was due to the memory constraints of running many large files or many operations within a file at once. Encapsulation allowed us to split that up and call on only what is needed. Encapsulation allows us to separate these operations, while still being able to pass data between them.

Encapsulation also contributes to data privacy, limiting the available 'surface area' for anyone to target.

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

Before true JS encapsulation, problems that arose were as follows:
-Breaking changes - Too much code was accessible to users, causing problems. If it's not intended for the user to interact with, they should not be able to access it.
-Expanded attack surface - Since nothing was nested or 'hidden' it was very exposed.
-Less dynamic code - If a change was made or an input type change, multiple changes needed to be made. Encapsulation allows us to be more dynamic and flexible. 

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

In order to declare a private variable with a class, we could either put all the variables and methods within the constructor or declare the variable pre-fixed with "#". One reason to declare a variable as private is to protect its value when the code runs or prevent issues with other classes using the same naming conventions.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I'm feeling much more comfortable with MVC structure after today's lecture and lab. Something that helped me to improve today was to start the lab by giving my HTML a rough outline and deciding on where some of my data would go ahead of time. I did this before really starting with any data manipulation or drawing to the screen. This prevented me from going back and forth between writing my HTML templates and trying to figure out my next steps in JavaScript. It allowed me to put more energy into allocating my JavaScript to its proper location in the MVC structure and ensuring that everything was 'talking' to each other correctly. Simply put, I didn't get ahead of myself today.
