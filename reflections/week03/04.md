> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the ***observer pattern*** seek to solve?

The observer pattern allows our code to 'watch' specified variables and draw them to the page when they change. This means that once an observer is set up to monitor a variable, we no longer need to cal a draw function every time that variable changes.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three methods are subscribe (add new event), unsubscribe (remove the specified event), and broadcast (call all events).

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template, and reflect on the `Proxy` objects from yesterday and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the DOM.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I think today's partner assignment went really well. When we first started out, we utilized git so we could each work on separate aspects of the project, then merged them. It got us off to a quick start when we were laying down the foundation with our HTML, creating templates, and setting up the MVC structure. Once we moved further into the JavaScript logic, we transitioned to working together on one computer. I think it was a great system and we got quite far with the time we had.
