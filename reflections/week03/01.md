## Questions

1. What problem does using ***exports*** solve?

Exports allow us to write code in one JavaScript file, then pull that code into another JavaScript file using an import. This allows use to use the same logic without re-writing code. This also means that JavaScript can be split into separate documents depending on their use to make code more readable. Debugging also becomes easier because the problems are more localized and faster to find. Additionally, splitting up the files gives us more naming options for variables and functions.

2. How does `export` differ from `export default`?

While modules can have multiple named exports, they can only have one export default. One main difference between the two is that when a named export is then imported, it must be called by its existing name. However, when an export default is imported, it can be renamed to whatever it is called on the import. This is because there is only one export default, so regardless of what we call it on the import, we will pull the same piece of logic. In other words, export default gives us the value, while export gives us a reference. In general, named exports should be used.

3. What is a benefit of using the "module" system?

The module system streamlines the way that JavaScript logic is accessed. By avoiding additional HTML script tags, page load times are reduced and the user experience is improved. It is also easier for the developer to use imports and exports rather than re-writing code or using excessive script tags in HTML.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I will definitely need some time to fully grasp the new structure we'll be working with. I can see the appeal of this type of structure, especially as the size of the projects one is working with start to increase. This approach makes things much more organized on a scalable level, even if if seems counterintuitive on a smaller project.
