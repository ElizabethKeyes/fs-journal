## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the ***handler***?

Get and set are two common operations to be used in the handler. These are referred to as traps.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every `get` to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

When using a trap on 'get' in your handler, it's important to return the value being stored in the key that was accessed, assuming access to that value is allowed/desired. Otherwise, our trap returns the specified custom content but the original 'get' request remains undefined.

3. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?

There are instances where one may want a specific property of an object to be private, such as an ID. If an attempt is made to access that property, we can use a 'get' trap to instead throw an error. Proxies can also be used for data validation using a 'set' trap. If the type of data coming through is not what was expected/required, we can throw a new error specifying that.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment was really useful practice for navigating using multiple models in the MVC structure. Additionally, we were able to simulate navigating to a different page by loading various templates to the same element depending on which button the user clicks. I hadn't thought of targeting the same id with different templates to achieve that before. Additionally, learning some more efficient ways to save to localStorage is definitely helpful and time-saving.
