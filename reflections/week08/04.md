## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Tests - Allow a developer to test small 'units' of code in an isolated environment. Unit testing allows us to be confident that each small unit is doing its job precisely, so if something is changed on a larger scale, we can count on those smaller elements to still serve their purpose.

Component Tests - In order to test components in Vue, we must first mount them to the DOM. In other words, we need the functions to actually run in order to verify their success/effectiveness. 

End-to-End Tests - As the name describes, end-to-end tests run through the entire application, including the server side. They can also test functionality across multiple browsers. This will reveal any errors that may occur when an a user is actually browsing the site/application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

At this time, component testing is what I've used most and what I'm most familiar with. I can clearly see that value in all three of these testing methods, and I'm sur they all have their appropriate time and place.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

For most situations, end-to-end testing seems it would be unnecessary. However, if an application is about to be deployed, a full end-to-end test should definitely be performed.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

It was a very productive day. We switched from partner programming to individual programming with frequent conversations when someone needed advice/help. We all still felt very productive and supported, but we were able to write significantly more code and enable much more functionality on our site than we did the previous today.
