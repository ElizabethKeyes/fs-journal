## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication is critical to the development process to ensure that all parties are informed of what the client's needs are, how the project is progressing, etc.

2. What adjustments from traditionally sized scrum teams need to be made to use the Agile methodology effectively in a small team?

An example of a potentially necessary adjustment for a smaller team would be changing communication style. Because there are fewer people, there may be people who serve multiple roles and their presence in multiple meetings may be required. In order to allow them to still have time to focus on the project itself, the way in which teams communicate may need to be adjusted. More frequent communication on Slack could allow less frequent in-person meetings.

3. What is the ***unattainable triangle***? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle would be a project which is cheap, quickly developed, and high quality. It is not plausible to have all three. If it is going to be high-quality and delivered quickly, it won't be cheap. Essentially, only two can be chosen at the same time.


Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today was spent planning our upcoming project. I certainly see why the importance of planning has been stressed. This process has brought up many questions that we'll need to address before our site is up and running, and it has even allowed us to solve a few of those problems before we've even begun writing code.
