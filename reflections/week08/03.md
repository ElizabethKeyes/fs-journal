## Questions

1. What is ***software development testing***?

Testing is basically what it sounds like, we need to test our code to ensure it is functioning as expected. Unit testing refers to testing small units of code, ensuring each unit is serving its intended purpose. 

2. What are the benefits of testing in software development?

There are a plethora of benefits to testing your code. Simply knowing without doubt that it works and will continue to do so for users is a primary benefit. Other benefits may include a more efficient process, easier debugging, confidence in the final product, etc.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of testing in software development?

Other than the fact that it may take some additional time, I don't see any drawbacks with test. The benefits greatly outweigh and additional time that may be spent. Debugging untested code would likely take even longer.
