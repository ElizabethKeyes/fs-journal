# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I feel that our group is working very well together, and we're all very interested and invested in the idea that we decided on for our capstone. Everyone is a very strong programmer and we're seeing great results so far.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

The amount of planning that went into everything was definitely more than I had initially expected. We planned for a solid day and a half and still felt that we needed to make updates to our Trello board and our Figma.

- What are you struggling with?

Our biggest struggle so far has been design, I think. We deviated pretty far from what our initial Figma looked like and that resulted in multiple conversations throughout the week about how things should look. That being said, I think we're in a great spot with the design at this point.

- What would you count as a victory?

We got really far with our website last week. I think we will have fully completed our MVP goals sometime during our Monday workday and I feel proud of that. Everyone's done a great job.
