## Questions

1. What function does a ***developer portfolio*** provide?

A developer portfolio serves a few purposes. It's a great way to showcase your work and your talent, effectively and succinctly. It can set you apart from other candidates and highlight your strengths.

2. What makes a developer portfolio effective?

An effective portfolio should have carefully selected projects that showcase the skills or languages one wishes to be highlighted. A portfolio shouldn't be too complex or have too many projects in it. 

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio? Why?

Tower would be a great project to include in a portfolio. Additionally, once capstones are done we should hopefully have another great project to add. These two projects showcase the ability to work on both the client side and server side of an application, as well as demonstrating the ability to plan and execute in a group setting.


Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

We primarily spent the day hearing about the newly assigned Capstone project and seeing examples given by the seniors. Towards the very end of the day, we began the planning stages of the project. The fact that we had brainstormed a little over the weekend allowed us to get a jump start on planning, since we already knew what our primary goal for the application was going to be.
