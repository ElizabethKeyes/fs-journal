## Questions

1. What are the three types of data relationships?

* One-to-one (1:1) - A relationship between two entities that are not tied to other entities. Example, an author and an address. Each author only has one address, and each address is solely tied to one author.

* One-to-many (1:N) - Consists of one object that can have relationships with many other objects, while the secondary object in the relationship only has relationship to the first. An example of this might be a blog with comments, where each comment only relates to the blog, but the blog relates to many comments.

* Many-to-many (N:M) - A relationship in which both objects may have multiple relationships with other objects in the database. For example, books and authors. A single book may have multiple authors, and those authors may also have multiple books related to them.

2. What are the benefits of traditional ***linking*** relationships over ***embedding*** relationships?

In a one-to-many relationship where the size of one object is known and static, but the other object may continually grow (going back to the blog post with comments example), there is a benefit to a linking relationship over an embedding relationship between these two pieces of data. When linked instead of embedded, the growing size of the comments array will not affect the blog post document. Additionally, it makes dividing the posts up into reasonable page sizes easier.

3. When modeling data, it's important to consider how a user will use and filter that data. How does this affect the way you model a ***many-to-many*** relationship? 

In a many-to-many relationship, one way embedding can be utilized to decrease the amount of time it takes to find a requested object in an array. For example, storing the genre of a book on the book object itself vs storing the book object in a massive array of similar books allows us to avoid filtering an array of that size to find one object. Another way to manage this large amount of data is to customize it by user, allowing individuals to save collections in their own personal arrays, making finding their frequently visited pages much easier.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I'm really enjoying getting further into Node and learning about the backend of APIs. I think the logic goes hand in hand with the learning we've been doing about accessing APIs and I have a good understanding of what I want those requests to return to the user. I'm definitely intrigued to get further into this and learn even more about the possible uses.
