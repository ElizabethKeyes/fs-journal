## Questions

1. What is a ***virtual property***?

A virtual property is a set of logic that will act on existing properties on an object to create a new property, without directly having to save that property to the object. An example would be a "fullName" virtual property that simply concatenates the saved "firstName" and "lastName" properties of an object.

2. When might you use a virtual property?

A virtual property would be useful in situations where the data we need can be calculated or derived from our existing data. This way, we do not have to save data that we could easily calculate or duplicate data that could easily be concatenated.

3. How do you search by a virtual property's value?

Virtual properties are not available for document queries, but their information can be extracted and drawn to the page using standard bracket notation.
