## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a ***query string***?

A query string allows us to pass information to and from a website by appending the query in the proper format to the end of a URL.

2. What is the format of a ***query parameter***? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter consists of a key/value pair. In a query string, the query parameter needs to be preceded by a question mark. If there are multiple query parameters in the string, they will need to be separated by ampersands.

3. When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

The first thing I think of with the application of query parameters is a menu that filters results. On click, each preference could be appended as an additional query, with the results only matching all the existing queries. I'm sure there are other applications as well that I look forward to learning about and utilizing.
