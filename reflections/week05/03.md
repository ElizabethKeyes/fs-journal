## Questions

1. In simple terms what is ***timeboxing***?

Timeboxing is a method in which a personal deadline is set while approaching a task. THe given amount of time should be rather short, anywhere from a few minutes up to a couple hours. It causes the person utilizing the strategy to stop and think about how to best utilize their time and prevents the process from dragging out beyond the point of productivity. In an educational setting, no success by the end of a set timebox may indicate that it is time to ask for help and get out of the personal struggle.  

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

* Be flexible. If at the end of a set period of time I haven't finished something or am stuck on something, it can be tough to take a break or step away to come back at a different time. Sometimes, that break can be very valuable in finding a solution.

* Swallow the frog - Starting with the hardest task first can remove that 'shadow' from the todo list and allow the rest of the day to move along in a smoother, well planned, and predictable way.

* Ruthlessly apply 'strategic quitting' - Often times, I will get too absorbed in a task that I can't figure out and end up spending an excessive amount of time on it. By forcing myself to take a step back and move on to something else, I will spend my time being productive rather than fighting against a problem that simply isn't going to be solved quite yet.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

There have been a couple times when working on checkpoints or labs that I've written some code that hasn't worked, then spent some time trying to fix it unsuccessfully. During one of these times, I realized that my focus had shifted from accomplishing the goal to fixing the code that had yet to work. I made the decision to delete the function and start again, approaching it from a different angle. In a much shorter amount of time, I had a function that served the purpose I had intended. It just took that step back and a reassessment of the problem.
