## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`

A primary key is used as the primary identifier for that row. Generally, this is an ID. A foreign key is declared when creating a table, and it ties that table to another table, where the foreign key matches the specified attribute on the specified reference table.

2. What is an ***alias***?

An alias allows us to declare an alternative name for one of our tables in a SQL statement. The alias is declared after the first reference to that table in a join statement, much like a C# variable would be declared with the type, then the name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM doctorsPatients
JOIN patients ON doctorsPatients.patientId = patients.id
JOIN doctors ON doctorsPatients.doctorId = doctors.id 
```
