Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today was pretty smooth sailing in the lab. I got my AllSpice to a place that I'm happy with, maybe not perfect styling but I hit all the goals and even added a comments component. I didn't quite get to the delete, but logged in users are capable of posting comments on any recipe, which is great. I'm nervous but also looking forward to the final. I think it'll be difficult but I'm ready to really put all these new skills to the test.
