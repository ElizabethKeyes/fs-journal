## Questions

1. What does ***inheritance*** accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to design classes (derived class) that will inherit properties from other classes (base class). A well-used example of this is having two classes within our account model. This way we can have a public profile, then a private account with additional properties that are only visible to the account owner. We can also use this to help us create flat objects with our many-to-many relationships instead of having deeply nested, more complicated objects.

2. How does ***member inheritance*** work in C#? Does a `Class` inherit all members of the base `Class`?

In C#, all members of a base class will be inherited by the derived class except for private members, and any constructors. Private members may, however, be accessible if that derived class is nested with the base class.

3. How does ***accessibility*** affect inheritance?

The 'private' access modifier will prevent most derived classes from inheriting that member of the base class. As mentioned above, this is not the case if the derived class is nested within the base class.


Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I hit a roadblock today with a bootstrap modal that took a while to fix. It was a reminder on how important timeboxing is and how quickly the time goes by when focus is directed at fixing a specific issue. In the end, I got it functioning, though maybe not exactly how I'd like in an ideal scenario. I left a note to come back to it upon finishing the other requirements if I have time. This way I can ensure that I'll have time to get all necessary parts of the application functioning, then if I have time I can go back and improve the appearance of that modal.
