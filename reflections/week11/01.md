## Questions

1. What does ***inheritance*** accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to design classes that will inherit properties from other classes. A well-used example of this is having two classes within our account model. This way we can have a public profile, then a private account with additional properties that are only visible to the account owner. We can also use this to help us create flat objects with our many-to-many relationships instead of having deeply nested, more complicated objects.

2. How does ***member inheritance*** work in C#? Does a `Class` inherit all members of the base `Class`?

3. How does ***accessibility*** affect inheritance?
