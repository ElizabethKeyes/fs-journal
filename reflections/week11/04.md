# Course Reflections

## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

I feel really proud of the way that the course has gone. I came in not really knowing much about code, and I feel much more confident and knowledgeable at this point. I've learned some great skills, but more importantly I've learned some of the basic principles that make it a little easier to learn more on my own. I have more confidence knowing that I've successfully learned languages and frameworks (at least to the point of being able to utilize key functionality, still not an expert over here), and I know I can do that again. I look forward to continuing to expand my coding knowledge after the course is over, and I look forward to the new avenues it has/will open up career-wise.
