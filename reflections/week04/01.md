## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of 'callback hell'?

'Callback hell' can be caused when people try to write code that will execute visually from top to bottom. Some signs that 'callback hell' has been reached are if there are many nested functions and logic. It will form a pyramid-type shape and there will be a plethora of closing brackets and parentheses at the bottom.

2. What does ***asynchronous*** mean, and how are callbacks involved?

By marking a function as 'async' or asynchronous, we are setting ourselves up to use an 'await' keyword to tell our program to wait for that result before continuing to run code. This allows us to eliminate a lot of that nested logic in 'callback hell'. Asynchronous code utilizes callbacks by completing an action upfront (ex/ downloading an image), but not doing anything with that information until it is called. This way, we can lessen load times and break our functions up, again to avoid 'callback hell'.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid/fix 'callback hell'.

* Keep your code shallow: if a 'callback hell' situation has multiple anonymous functions, give those functions names and split them up. This reduces each code block to a smaller, more readable size.

* Modularize: Keep alike code in the same files, move dissimilar code to its own relevant file. If properly using the MVC structure throughout the development of a project, it should already be modular. If the project was started without using the MVC structure, more reorganizing would be necessary, but may be warranted in favor of having an organized application.

* Handle every single error: When utilizing callback functions and server requests, not 100% of our attempts to retrieve or send data will be successful. Within our functions, we need to consider the possibility that some of our requests will come back with errors and make a plan to handle those errors. In general, it is a good idea to pop an error on the screen as well as the console so that the user is aware that something went wrong, and it doesn't simply appear like nothing happened.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment was a great experiment with APIs. After the course over the weekend, I was slightly intimidated but felt more prepared for this week. After the lecture, I felt that I had a much better understanding of how to utilize an API. It was pretty simple to get a pre-selected array of objects to draw to the screen, but utilizing the drop down menu to have the user select a set of questions proved to be tricky. I also need to take another look at my functions, because some of the punctuation in a couple of the answers caused them to draw to the screen incorrectly or not at all, in some cases. I didn't have enough time in lab to troubleshoot that issue but I look forward to learning more about how to handle the sometimes unexpected returns from an API by writing more dynamic and flexible code.
