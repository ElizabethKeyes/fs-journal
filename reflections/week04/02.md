> **ðŸ“– [JavaScript Promises](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/02-Promises)**

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

A promise can either be 'pending', 'resolved', or 'rejected'. Pending promises are not yet complete. Resolved promises are successful, and rejected promises have some type of error. 

2. How do `Promise`s seek to resolve the issues of 'callback hell'?

Utilizing promises in place of callbacks can help to make our code more readable since we are attaching the callbacks with a 'then' keyword and returning a call to another function, rather than continuing to pass functions as arguments into other functions. This also allows us to use a single 'catch' at the end to catch any potential errors, again slimming down the code.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then() is what will be executed if the promise comes back resolved, the catch() code block will be executed if the promise returns an error. Both are important to utilize when working with promises.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I thought today's lab went great. I'm enjoying getting more familiar with APIs and how to best utilize them. It'll take some practice to get used to and memorize the syntax associated with the various CRUD methods, but that will come with time and practice. (ex/ remembering to splice the array in the AppState when edited data is pushed to the API)

Using the Bootstrap modal for the form threw me off a little bit since I hadn't used that before, it caused me a couple problems that I wouldn't have had with a hard-coded form, but it was valuable and interesting to learn about Bootstrap modals regardless. I'm sure I'll continue to use those moving forward, they are definitely a useful tool.
