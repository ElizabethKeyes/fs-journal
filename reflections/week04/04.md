## Questions

1. What does ***REST*** stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. When a RESTful API is called upon, the server will transfer to the user a representation of the current state of that object/data.

2. What does ***stateless*** mean?

Stateless means that the server does not keep any information on the person who is requesting data from the API, or if they've ever requested data from it before.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a ***RESTful API***?

URLs for a restful API need to include identifying information for each object. For example, appending an id to the URL for the collection should find that specific item.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

During today's lab, we encountered a problem with a put operation because we hadn't altered the array that was saved in the AppState, we had only pushed the changes into the sandbox. Because of this, the changes were not showing up until we refreshed the page, even though the Gits were re-drawing upon being opened. They were re-drawing based on outdated information in the AppState. Once we inserted the splice() line of logic, it worked as expected.
