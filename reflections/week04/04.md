## Questions

1. What does ***REST*** stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. When a RESTful API is called upon, the server will transfer to the user a representation of the current state of that object/data.

2. What does ***stateless*** mean?

Stateless means that the server does not keep any information on the person who is requesting data from the API, or if they've ever requested data from it before.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a ***RESTful API***?
