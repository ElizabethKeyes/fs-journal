## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `async`/`await`?

The async and await keywords allow us to declare functions as asynchronous and let the program know where it needs to stop running until our promise is returned as either resolved or rejected. After which, the code will continue to run.

2. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

First, the function will need to be declared with the async keyword, then the await keyword will be placed before the code that we need to wait for the return value of.

ex/

`async getData(){`

 ` let res = await sandbox.get()`

 `console.log(res.data)`

`}`

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `async`/`await`?


In the example above, if the function were not asynchronous, the console log would return undefined. Since it's been declared as async, the program will wait for that data to return before moving onto the next line. There are many applications for async functions, one of the main ones we've been working with recently is waiting for a response from an API before then manipulating the returned data.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Working with two APIs at the same time definitely added another layer of complexity to today's lab. Utilizing the same model led to a couple hiccups, but was overall a great learning experience. The data changes as it travels through these different databases, so making an adaptive/dynamic constructor proved to be pretty tricky, but satisfying once it all worked out. I felt great bout how today's lab went.
