## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

In a SQL table, the rows refer to complete objects, such as a book. The columns refer to the properties on that object, such as author, length, genre, etc.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called "characters" with the values "name, age, description" as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age int NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR NOT NULL
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

'DELETE FROM table_name' will remove one or more (up to all) rows from a table, while still leaving the table and its columns intact.
'DROP TABLE table_name' will delete the table itself, including all the data it holds.


Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

We started the AllSpice checkpoint today. I feel like it's going great so far. I definitely need to continue practicing my SQL statements, but I'm getting more comfortable with C# and I appreciate the precise errors it provides. I only have two more requests to write in order to satisfy the postman tests, so I feel great about where I'm at with the project at this point and I hope to branch out to the front end side of things tomorrow.
