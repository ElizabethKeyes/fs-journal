## Questions

1. What is a `List` in C#?

A list is a collection of data. When a list is declared, we can declare a strict type, so the list may only contain data of that declared type.

2. What `List` methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List[index] and List.add are definitely methods that I'd imagine would be frequently used to add and retrieve data from that list. List.addRange also seems useful for combining lists, similar to .join() in javascript.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a `List`? What method could you use?

To retrieve a specific item with a known index, we could use list[index] or list.find. If we did not know the index, we could use list.binarySearch or list.findIndex to find the index of the given value.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I hit some road bumps early on in today's lab with my VSCode setup, so I got a late start. I'm definitely still pretty shaky with C# and SQL, the logic is making sense but the syntax is taking some getting used to. In particular, I don't quite understand the ExecuteScalar() or a few of the other new methods we're working with. I'll be continuing to research and practice and I look forward to improving and becoming more comfortable.
