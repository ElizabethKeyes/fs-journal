## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Type - This data type holds the actual value within its memory space. The variable contains the value itself.

Reference Type - Unlike value type, reference type does not hold the actual value of the variable, it simply holds a reference to the location where that value is held (via the memory address). The default value of a reference type variable before initialization is null.

Pointer Type - Pointers are similar to references, but with a few key distinctions. References point to an object's location in memory, whereas a pointer simply points a location in memory, whether or not the object that you expect is there. Additionally, pointers are not type safe. With references, we can assure that we are either pointing to the desired data type, or null. With pointers, we do not have this type safety.

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Bool, byte, char, decimal, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, and ushort are all value-type data types. There are a wider variety of data types than in JavaScript, and we haven't worked with some of them at all. Upon reading about these types a little bit, many of these new types are numeric types with relatively specific requirements on the values they can hold. "Signed" variables can negative, while "unsigned" variables must be either zero or positive.

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

Reference types are stored essentially as an address. They point to a place in the database where the actual value is held. Value types do not store an address, they store the value itself. The references are updated during garbage collection.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

C# is definitely going to take some getting used to, but I feel like I'm starting to understand the functionality we're working with after today's lab. The setup of the controllers and services is still confusing, but after writing a couple of the functions, I felt much more comfortable writing the rest of them and I understand the logic. I still need some practice with the new syntax of course, but I look forward to practicing and improving throughout the rest of this week.
