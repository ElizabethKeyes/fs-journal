## Questions

1. What is an ***Enum***, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. They allow us to work with symbolic names for those constant values in order to have more readable and easy to understand code. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?

The type of the enum can be modified upon declaration, as well as the values it holds. The values of the enum members can consist of any value that is valid for the declared type of the enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far? (if you have not yet, give an example of how you could.)

I haven't used any enums so far in C#, but one possible use case would be in a switch statement. Say we have months of the year stored in our database as numerical values and we want to switch that integer for a string of the corresponding month. We could make this switch statement simply using those integer values, but it wouldn't be very readable or accessible to anyone who references our code in the future. Instead, we could reference our enum values, and the switch statement would now include those names for easy readability.



Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today was a really productive workday on our current checkpoint. I finished up the backend for now, and I moved onto laying out the page. I was able to successfully make my first request to the api and everything is looking great so far. I'm definitely going to keep mobile view in mind as well, and ensure that it looks great on multiple screen sizes.
